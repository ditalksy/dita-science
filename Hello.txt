Hello, world! Welcome to Dita Science :)
see what I did there hehe

It's Monday, September 21st 2020 and I'm here in my room trying to think of ways to be productive.
I've been interested in big data ever since the topic arrived into my brain last year from friends and family.
Ever since then, I've been making it my career mission to wrangle with data,
personally I find it more convenient than dealing with people am I right? Haha.
Got myself a tech internship at one of the biggest unicorns in South-East Asia and I've been loving it since then.
Took it upon myself to learn more about it during this pandemic since there is nothing but time,
until I get the right job.

So I thought, why not share my learning journey?

Through this journal, I hope I could:
1. Share my knowledge with others who are also interested in becoming literate in data.
2. Build a portofolio for future opportunity that might arise.
3. Document and keep track of what I know, what I've learnt, what I don't know, and what I want to learn.
4. Be better at writing.
5. Keep myself motivated.

Until then,
Ditalksy.
